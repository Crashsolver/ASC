V 0.90.0  Initial program and upload

V 0.90.1  Some minor GUI fixes

V 0.91  Added Auto-Update functionality

V 0.91.1 Fixed lookup without entering a callsign

V 0.92  Added an Auto-Purge function to the Update function. This removes any VE who has lost 
        their ARRL accreditation from the database. Also reworked the Lookup button. If one 
        has registered their callsign, clicking on the button without entering a callsign 
        will automatically lookup one's statistics. Also reworked the Summary report. For
        1x2 or 2x1 callsigns, if there is a multiple match, one can add a '!' to the end
        of their callsign which will restrict the matching process. It's not perfect. Dropped
        the "Import by State" option which was for testing purposes.

V 0.92.1 Added a check for a new VE during an update
